    <string name="atw_text">I walked through the door with you
        \nThe air was cold
        \nBut something about it felt like home somehow
        \nAnd I, left my scarf there at your sister\'s house
        \nAnd you\'ve still got it in your drawer even now
        \nOh, your sweet disposition
        \nAnd my wide-eyed gaze
        \nWe\'re singing in the car, getting lost upstate
        \nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
        \nAnd I can picture it after all these days
        \nAnd I know it\'s long gone and that magic\'s not here no more
        \nAnd I might be okay but I\'m not fine at all
        \n\'Cause there we are again on that little town street
        \nYou almost ran the red \'cause you were lookin\' over at me
        \nWind in my hair, I was there
        \nI remember it all too well
        \nPhoto album on the counter
        \nYour cheeks were turning red
        \nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
        \nAnd your mother\'s telling stories \'bout you on the tee-ball team
        \nYou told me \'bout your past thinking your future was me
        \nAnd I know it\'s long gone and there was nothing else I could do
        \nAnd I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
        \n\'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
        \nWe\'re dancing \'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
        \nDown the stairs, I was there
        \nI remember it all too well, yeah
        \nAnd maybe we got lost in translation
        \nMaybe I asked for too much
        \nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece \'til you tore it all up
        \nRunning scared, I was there
        \nI remember it all too well
        \nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise
        \nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest
        \nI\'m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
        \n\'Cause I remember it all, all, all
        \nToo well
        \nTime won\'t fly, it\'s like I\'m paralyzed by it
        \nI\'d like to be my old self again
        \nBut I\'m still trying to find it
        \nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
        \nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone
        \nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week
        \n\'Cause it reminds you of innocence
        \nAnd it smells like me
        \nYou can\'t get rid of it
        \n\'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
        \n\'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
        \nBack before you lost the one real thing you\'ve ever known
        \nIt was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
        \nWind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
        \nDown the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
        \nIt was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well</string>
    <string name="cs_text">Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
        \nYou know that I caught it
        \nBad, bad boy
        \nShiny toy with a price
        \nYou know that I bought it
        \nKilling me slow, out the window
        \nI\'m always waiting for you to be waiting below
        \nDevils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
        \nWhat doesn\'t kill me makes me want you more
        \nAnd it\'s new, the shape of your body
        \nIt\'s blue, the feeling I\'ve got
        \nAnd it\'s ooh, whoa, oh
        \nIt\'s a cruel summer
        \nIt\'s cool, that\'s what I tell \'em
        \nNo rules in breakable heaven
        \nBut ooh, whoa oh
        \nIt\'s a cruel summer
        \nWith you
        \nHang your head low
        \nIn the glow of the vending machine
        \nI\'m not dying
        \nYou say that we\'ll just screw it up in these trying times
        \nWe\'re not trying
        \nSo cut the headlights, summer\'s a knife
        \nI\'m always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
        \nDevils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
        \nAnd if I bleed, you\'ll be the last to know
        \nOh, it\'s new, the shape of your body
        \nIt\'s blue, the feeling I\'ve got
        \nAnd it\'s ooh, whoa, oh
        \nIt\'s a cruel summer
        \nIt\'s cool, that\'s what I tell \'em
        \nNo rules in breakable heaven
        \nBut ooh, whoa, oh
        \nIt\'s a cruel summer
        \nWith you
        \nI\'m drunk in the back of the car
        \nAnd I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
        \nSaid, I\'m fine, but it wasn\'t true
        \nI don\'t wanna keep secrets just to keep you
        \nAnd I snuck in through the garden gate
        \nEvery night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)
        \nAnd I screamed for whatever it\'s worth
        \nI love you,  ain\'t that the worst thing you ever heard?
        \nHe looks up grinning like a devil
        \nIt\'s new, the shape of your body
        \nIt\'s blue, the feeling I\'ve got
        \nAnd it\'s ooh, whoa, oh
        \nIt\'s a cruel summer
        \nIt\'s cool, that\'s what I tell \'em
        \nNo rules, in breakable heaven
        \nBut ooh, whoa, oh
        \nIt\'s a cruel summer
        \nWith you
        \nI\'m drunk in the back of the car
        \nAnd I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (h)
        \nSaid, I\'m fine, but it wasn\'t true
        \nI don\'t wanna keep secrets just to keep you
        \nAnd I snuck in through the garden gate
        \nEvery night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)

    <string name="e_text">There I was again tonight\n
        Forcing laughter, faking smiles\n
        Same old tired, lonely place\n
        Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy\n
        Vanished when I saw your face\n
        All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you\n
        Your eyes whispered, Have we met?\n
        \'Cross the room your silhouette\n
        Starts to make its way to me\n
        The playful conversation starts\n
        Counter all your quick remarks\n
        Like passing notes in secrecy\n
        And it was enchanting to meet you\n
        All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you\n
        This night is sparkling, don\'t you let it go\n
        I\'m wonderstruck, blushing all the way home\n
        I\'ll spend forever wondering if you knew\n
        I was enchanted to meet you\n
        The lingering question kept me up\n
        2 AM, who do you love?\n
        I wonder \'til I\'m wide awake\n
        And now I\'m pacing back and forth\n
        Wishing you were at my door\n
        I\'d open up and you would say, Hey\n
        It was enchanting to meet you\n
        All I know is, I was enchanted to meet you\n
        This night is sparkling, don\'t you let it go\n
        I\'m wonderstruck, blushing all the way home\n
        I\'ll spend forever wondering if you knew\n
        That this night is flawless, don\'t you let it go\n
        I\'m wonderstruck, dancing around all alone\n
        I\'ll spend forever wondering if you knew\n
        I was enchanted to meet you\n
        This is me praying that\n
        This was the very first page\n
        Not where the story line ends\n
        My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again\n
        These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon\n
        I was enchanted to meet you\n
        Please don\'t be in love with someone else\n
        Please don\'t have somebody waiting on you\n
        Please don\'t be in love with someone else\n
        Please don\'t have somebody waiting on you\n
